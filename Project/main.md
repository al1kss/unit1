# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is the owner of a popular and successful Blockchain company. The main concern of my client at the moment is the multiple passwords that employees have to use for the company's multiple software applications. His employees keep their passwords in one big company's Spreadsheet. Any company email account can access this spreadsheet. So if one employee gets hacked everyone will get as well.  My

## Proposed Solution
I propose to my client to create a password manager app. To make it more secure it will be hidden behind another commonly used app in a company. This app will be a "prediction machine". It will draw a prediction of overall growth or (down) of ALL products in a blockchain. ###(2/3 it will rise, 1/3 it will go down)

## Success Criteria
PAY ATTENTION TO WORDS

1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
3. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
4. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
5. Save passwords permanently and securely  ###use some hashing etc.
6. Use the terminal to interact with the user.

# Criterion B: Design
### System Diagram

### Flow diagrams for algorithms

### Data storage

### Sketches of the application (wireframe diagrams)
Do a "predicting machine" that randomly draws diagram (use / | \ to draw) (or library) 
### Test plan
