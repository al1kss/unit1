# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is the owner of a successful and growing Blockchain company. The company is currently facing two key issues: (1) employees lack a centralized platform for managing and monitoring multiple blockchain accounts, and (2) passwords for various accounts are stored insecurely in a shared company spreadsheet, which is accessible via any company email account. This setup exposes the company to significant security risks; if one employee's email account is compromised, all sensitive information, including passwords, could be at risk.

## Proposed Solution
To address these concerns, I propose developing a secure password manager app for the client. This app will allow employees to store and manage their passwords safely and securely. In order to enhance security, the password manager will be concealed behind another commonly used company app, specifically the companyâ€™s blockchain platform itself. This platform is very similar to Instagram etc. Employees will not need to open a separate application; instead, they will access the password manager by logging into their admin accounts within the blockchain platform, ensuring seamless and secure integration.

**Fig2 The best quote**


## Success Criteria

1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
2. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
3. If the user enters the secret code ("tooLazy"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
4. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
5. Save passwords permanently and securely
6. Use the terminal to interact with the user.


# Criterion B: Design
## VERY IMPORTANT
>Please run the code on your PC(on terminal), to get a full understanding of potential of this code
>
>To get access to password manager you have to LOG IN with "username":notAdminTrustMe "password":root OR just write "tooLazy" at the log in menu
>
>Everything can be changed (password username etc.), try creating your own account.
>
>Please spend some time to use all options

>THANK YOU!

### Citation
Used in my code {:<10} to align text: https://mkaz.blog/working-with-python/string-formatting
Got idea for list of games: chatgpt.com
Used this website to generate ASCII text: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/
Got inspiration to shuffle the list to encrypt from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsLBErLWBhA&ab_channel=BroCode
Understood how to decrypt using the above encryption method with the help of: ruben.pinzon@uwcisak.jp

## All code for this program
> Download all code -> put it in one folder -> run real_main.py
> 
> Check Project/Codes/ to get all code and .csv

### Explanation of files
> real_main.py --- Is where the main code is. And all UI is as well
> 
> main.py --- Is where the Password Manager is
> 
> games.py --- Is where all games are
> 
> colors.py --- Where all variables to change color easily across all files are stored
> 
> database.csv --- Where all accounts and their encrypted passwords with seed are stored
> 
> accounts.csv --- Where accounts name and their balance is stored (Could be implemented in database.csv as 4th element, but to make life easier created this)
> 
> games.csv --- List of all games, and how much you earn per every win in a game
> 
> word_scramble.txt --- List of words used for Word Scramble game

Thank you for checking out my code!
